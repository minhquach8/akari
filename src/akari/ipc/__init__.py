"""
Inter-process communication (IPC) and agent messaging subsystem.

This package defines message structures (AgentMessage, MessageKind, MessageRole), the in-memory message bus used for agent communication, and the AgentRuntime loop responsible for receiving, handling, and responding to messages.

This IPC layer enables multi-agent workflows, planner–worker patterns, and cross-framework orchestration through the Kernel.
