Use Case 0.2.3 – Registry with a file resource.

This file is reserved by the Implementation Plan.

In a later step we will:
- define a ResourceSpec representing a file (e.g. a local CSV),
- register it with the IdentityRegistry,
- list RESOURCE specs from the registry and inspect their metadata,
- and demonstrate how disabled resources are hidden by default.
