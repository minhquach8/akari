Use Case 0.2.1 – Registry with sklearn Iris model.

This file is reserved by the Implementation Plan.

In a later step we will:
- create a real sklearn Iris classifier,
- wrap it in a ModelSpec with runtime="sklearn",
- register it in the Kernel's IdentityRegistry,
- and print a short summary of the registered model spec.
